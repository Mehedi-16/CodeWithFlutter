### 📐 Slide 7: Flowchart

> _We start by launching the app, showing a splash screen with logo and welcome message._  
> _If it’s the first time, users see intro slides about app features._

> _Login options include admin, registered user, or guest. Admins use email/password; others can log in or continue as guest._

> _After login, users land on the home screen with Bangla-English toggle and service icons like emergency, hospitals, education, transport, NGOs, news, and more._

> _Selecting any category opens the service view. Data is fetched from Firebase or MySQL. Admins can add/edit/delete; users can view and give feedback._

> _Users can keep browsing services. Logged-in users also get profile features — edit info, view history, and track usage._

> _Finally, users can log out or exit anytime._

> _This flowchart shows a complete journey — clean, role-based, and user-friendly._

### 📊 Slide 8: ER Diagram

> There are two main roles:  
> – **Citizen User:** can search services, submit reports, get alerts  
> – **Admin:** can publish updates, manage listings, and reply to feedback
